To install News Lister on your website, you just need
to unzip NewsLister.zip and copy the files to your preferred folder.

The administration panel will be available on - 

[your installation folder]/admin 

and the default username and password will be -

username: administrator
password: abc123

(after you log in, you can change them with different ones you may prefer)

So for example if you upload it on:

www.yourdomain.com/test

then the administration panel will be available on:

www.yourdomain.com/test/admin
username: administrator
password: abc123
